# Offensive Cyber Security Course

Milestone Project 1 - User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute.


This is a Cyber security course website, exposing the visitors to a total of 8 tools and 8 techniques
to get them interested, but not intimidated or overwhelmed.

## UX
Centralize all relevant information for the visitors and make navigation easy, so they can get a quick
overview, drawing their attention until they get the option to register while being interested
in the course.

Strong colors have been choosen to clearly separate the topics as they scroll through the website
as well limiting the word count to keep the topic relevant and interesting.


## Technologies

1. HTML
1. CSS
1. Bootstrap
1. FontAwesome
1. jQuery
1. PopperJS


## Wireframe tool
For all wireframe work I have used
[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com)

## Features
The website uses Bootstrap Javascript and Modal for registration and pop-up messages, to
confirm for the client that they have registered.

## Planned features
Planning on adding a test hacking section to the website, where people can try themself at hacking a login field
to see if they enjoy the hacking process, before landing on a registration page, this will require
some light Javascript.

## Testing
### Responsive Design
The website have been tested on all popular browsers to confirm all information is displayed
correct on (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

The following have been tested.

1. Navbar buttons on full screen and on mobile device sizes.
1. All buttons on the page brings up modal window as designed.
1. There is no required class implemented on the modal forms, so they work regardless of the information.
1. Footer icons link correctly and safely.
1. Fixed all bugs through W3 Validator for index.html and style.css.



Confirmed it is working with all popular device sizes.

1. 320 x 568 iPhone 5/SE
1. 360 x 640 Galaxy S5
1. 375 x 667 iPhone 6/7/8
1. 375 x 812 iPhone X
1. 411 x 731 Pixel 2
1. 411 x 823 Pixel 2 XL
1. 414 x 736 iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
1. 768 x 1024 iPad
1. 1024 x 1366 iPad Pro


### Responsive scaling issues with headline
While the design works correct on all sizes mentioned above, except the Hero headline text, it breaks when scaling manually
between sizes, using responsive mode in developer tools, but works on the set sizes.
