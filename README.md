<h1>Offensive Cyber Security Course</h1>

<p>Milestone Project 1 - User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Insitute.</p>


<p>This is a Cyber security course website, exposing the visitors to a total of 8 tools and 8 techniques
to get them interested, but not intimidated or overwhelmed.

<h2>UX</h2>
<p>Centralize all relevant information for the visitors and make navigation easy, so they can get a quick
overview, drawing their attention until they get the option to register while being interested
in the course.</p>

<p>Strong colors have been choosen to clearly seperate the topics as they scroll through the website
as well limiting the word count to keep the topic relevant and interesting.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The website uses Bootstrap Javascript and Modal for registration and pop-up messages, to
confirm for the client that they have registered.</p>

<h2>Planned features</h2>
<p>Planning on adding a test hacking section to the website, where people can try themself at hacking a login field
to see if they enjoy the hacking process, before landing on a registration page, this will require
some light Javascripting.<p>

correct on (Chrome, Firefox, Edge). </p>
