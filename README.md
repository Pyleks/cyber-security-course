<h1>Offensive Cyber Security Course</h1>

<p>Milestone Project 1 - User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Insitute.</p>


<p>This is a Cyber security course website, exposing the visitors to a total of 8 tools and 8 techniques
to get them interested, but not intimidated or overwhelmed.

<h2>UX</h2>
<p>Centralize all relevant information for the visitors and make navigation easy, so they can get a quick
overview, drawing their attention until they get the option to register while being interested
in the course.</p>

<p>Strong colors have been choosen to clearly seperate the topics as they scroll through the website
as well limiting the word count to keep the topic relevant and interesting.</p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<ol>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Bootstrap (4.3.1)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The website uses Bootstrap Javascript and Modal for registration and pop-up messages, to
confirm for the client that they have registered.</p>

<h2>Planned features</h2>
<p>Planning on adding a test hacking section to the website, where people can try themself at hacking a login field
to see if they enjoy the hacking process, before landing on a registration page, this will require
some light Javascripting.<p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
<p>The website have been tested on all popular browsers to confirm all information is displayed
correct on (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).</p>
<p>Confirmed it is working with all popular device sizes. </p>

<h3>Responsive scaling issues</h3>
<p>While the design works correct on all sizes mentioned above, it breaks when scaling manually between sizes, using respnsive mode
in developer tools, especially the hero image and the images below.
iphone 6/7/8 Plus have a white line on the right side of the screen in chrome responsive scaling, but not in Firefox.
